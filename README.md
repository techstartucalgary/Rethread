## üöÄ Backend Documentation

All the code is located in the `backend/src` directory. The backend is written using [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) and [Express](https://expressjs.com/).

### üèÉ Quickstart

1. Make sure you have `Node.js` and `NPM` installed on your machine. Click [here](https://nodejs.org/en/) to download and install Node.js. Make sure you install the LTS version. NPM is installed automatically when you install Node.js.

2. Open the terminal and run `node -v` to check if `Node.js` is installed.

```bash
node -v
```

3. In the same terminal run `npm -v` to check if `npm` is installed.

```bash
npm -v
```

4. If you see the version number of `Node.js` and `npm` then you are good to go. If not, then try to reinstall `Node.js`.

5. Make sure you have `MySQL` installed on your machine. Click [here](https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/mysql/) to download and install MySQL. Make sure you install the latest version.
